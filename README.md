# English Grammar
> 此文档是我根据 烧风的小站[一篇博客](https://hk-shao.github.io/post/81c4e30a.html) 抄来的, 实事是: 我把整篇文章看完, 还记不住, 就想着顺便用 markdown 手写一份(我也新学了下 `markdown` 的语法), 加深记忆的. 感受得出作者是很用心整理的, 我很感谢他, `侵删`.

## 语法
-----
句子是人类语言的核心构造, 动词是句子的核心. 所以学习英语语法需从句子开始.
学习语法 --> 分析句子
分析句子 --> 理清句子成分
分析句子 --> 理清句子关系

## 1.句子成分
1. 主语: 句子所陈述的对象.
2. 谓语: 主语发出的动作. 一般是有动作意义的动词.
3. 宾语: 分为动词宾语和介词宾语, 属于动作的承受者.
4. 系动词: 表示状态或状态变化的动词, 没有实际的动作意义.
   如:
      > be 动词 (`am`, `is` , `are`);    
      感官系动词 (`look`, `sound`, `smell`, `taste`, `feel`);    
      保持类系动词 (`keep`, `stay`, `remain`);    
      状态变化类系动词 (`become`, `get`, `turn`, `go`)    
   等.  
5. 表语: 紧跟系动词后的成份.
6. 定语: 修饰名词或代词的成份.
7. 状语: 修饰形容词 / 副词 / 动词 或句子的成分.
8. 补语: 分为宾语补足语和主语补足语. 是对宾语和主语的补充说明, 与其有主动或被动的逻辑关系.

## 2.句型
名子的基本结构: 主语 + 谓语(名词 + 动词)
### 五种句型
模式|例句|分析
:--:|:--:|:--:
主系表|I am a student|I 主语, am 系动词, a student 表语
主谓|I am studying|I 主语, am studying 谓语
主谓宾|I study English|I 主语, study 谓语, English 宾语
主谓间宾直宾|Our teacher taught us English|Our teacher 主语, taught 谓语, us 间宾, English 直宾
主谓宾宾补|I learn English well|I 主语, Learn 谓语, English 宾语, well 宾补

关键在于谓语动词, 它构成了一个句子的骨架   
 
#### 主语 + 系动词 + 主语补足语(表语)   
> 系动词(Linking Verg)   
> 作用: 无具体运作, 仅起连接作用   
> 后面所接成分: 说明主语特点性质特征    
> 种类: be 动词(`am`, `is`, `are`), `look`, `sound`, `smell`, `tast`, `feel`, `seem`, `appear`, `become`, `turn`. 
> 表语: 名词 or 形容词

#### 主语 + 谓语 (+ 状语)
> 不及物动词(Intransitive Verb) vi.   
> 特点: 主语自身可完成, 不需要作用对象   
> 习惯: 带状语(修饰动作的句子成分)

#### 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语
> 及对动词(Transitive Verb)vt.
> 作用: 说明主语动作的作用对象.
> 宾语: 主语动作承受对象

#### 主语 + 谓语 + 间宾 + 直宾
> 双宾动词(Dative Verb)
> 特点: 后面成分有人(间接宾语[接受者]), 又有物(直接宾语[承受者])

#### 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 + 宾语补足语
> 宾补动词(Factitive Verb)

### 区分双宾语和复合宾语
在间接宾语后加上 be 动词, 若能成句, 则是补足语

动词种类|句型
:--:|:--:
Linking verb(连系动词)|主 + 系 + 表
Intransitive Verb(不及物动词)|主 + 谓
Transitive Verb(及物动词)|主 + 谓 + 宾
Transitive Verb with direct object and indirect object|主 + 谓 +间宾 +直宾
Transitive Verb with direct object and object complement|主 + 谓 + 宾 +宾补

## 3.动词的分类

### 实义动词_Notional_Verb
> 词义: 完整    
> 作用: 能独立充当谓语    
> 分类: 助动词和情态动词以外的动词

### 助动词_Auxiliary_Verb
> 词义: 不完整    
> 作用: 无法独立充当谓语    
>      必须与实义动词连用, 构成各种时态, 语态, 语气, 否定, 疑问   
> 分类:    
     * Be: `am`, `is`, `are`, `was`, `were`, `been`, `being`    
     * Do: `does`, `did`   
     * Have: `has`, `had`, `having`

#### Be 类
> 变化形式: `am`, `is`, `are`, `was`, `were`, `been`, `being`    
> 功能:    
> 1. 帮助构成进行时态   
> I am studying grammar.   
> He is playing football.
> 2. 帮助构成被动语态   
> I was cheated.

#### Do 类
> 变化形式: `does`, `did`    
> 功能: 
> 1. 帮助实义动词构成否定    
> I do not like English.
> 2. 帮助实义动词构成疑问   
>  Do you like English.

#### Have 类
> 变化形式: `has`, `had`, `having`   
> 功能: 帮助构成完成时态    
> I have studied English for 3 years.

be, do, have 可作实义动词又可作助动词
分类|例句|词义|词性及作用
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
be|I am a student|"是"|系动词, 作谓语
-|I am studying grammar|无词义|助动词, 构成进行时
have|I have two brothers|"有"|实义动词, 作谓语
-|I have studied English for 3 years|无词义|助动词帮助构成完成时
do| I often do my homework at home|"做"|实义动词, 作谓语
-|I do not link English|无词义|助动词, 构成否定

### 情态动词_Modal_Verb
> 词义: 有词义, 表示说话者对某种行为或状态的看法或态度  
> 无法独立充当谓语, 必须和实义动词一起构成复合谓语  
> 常见: `can`, `could`, `may`, `might`, `must`, `shall`, `should`, `will`, `would`, `have to`, `ought to`, `used to`, `need`, `dare`  

## 名子的变化
### 陈述句否定
#### 谓语动态含有助动词或情态动词
> 变形: 助动词或情态动词后 + not   
> 例:   
> He is a teacher. -> He is not a teacher.  
> I can swim. -> I cannot swim.
> He will come to the party. -> He will not come to the party.
#### 谓语动词是实义动词
> 变形: 借助助动词的 do not 来构成, 第三人称用 does + not + 动词原型, 过去式 did + not  
> 例:  
> I like English. -> I do not like English.  
> He like English. -> He does not like English.  
> There are some dogs. -> There aren't any dogs.

## 人称代词
### 主格人称代词
作用: 主语或从句中做主语  
> She is my daughter.  
It was he who helped me when I was in trouble.  
顺序: you, he, I; we, you, they(I 总是放在最后)

表示泛指的主格代词  
one: 任何人, 包括说话人
> ~~one is knocking at the door.~~ (错误, 句子中 One 逻辑上不会包含说话人, 不符合 one 的规则)  
Somebody is knocking at the door.  
One 后面使用的代词, 美国一般用 he, him, himself, his.   

We / You / They 可以表示泛指: 人们.  
> They say = People say or It is say  
They say it is going to be a cold winter.  

she(her)的拟人化  
表示 country, motherland, moon, earth, ship  
> The ship lost most of her rigging in the storm.  

### 宾格人称代词
作用: 做宾语, 也可做表语  
>I like her.  
Whh is it? It's me.  
注意: 做表语时, 后面跟定语从句是, 需要用主格人称代词.  
It was `he` in whom we had the greatest faith. (he 在从句中做介词宾语)  

主格和宾格人称代码可做同位语  
> `We teachers` should be patient with students.  
Our teachers are all nice to `us students`.  

做宾语时的位置  
直接宾语前: He bought me a pen as birthday gift.   
直接宾语后: He boutht a pen for me as a birthday gift; I've lent much money to him.  

若直接宾语是人称代词, 只能置后, 但是不适用于不定代词:  
> I will give it to you.  
I'll show you something; I didn't give Rex any.  

在短语动词中间: hand them in; throw it away; pick it up.  
若是名词, 则中间和后边都可以: hand your papers in = hand in your papers.

### 物主代词(名词性&形容词性)
作用: 人称代词的所有格式, 表所有关系  
形容词性:
> 不能单独使用: Your book is over there; His sister is lovely.  
表强调时 + own: I wish I had my own house.  

名词性:   
> 单独使用; 避免重复: This is not my book, Mine(= my book) is in my bag.   
of + 名词性物主代词: a friend fo mine; a teacher of hers = a teacher of her own.

### 反身代词
必须主语宾语为同一人时, 做宾语: God helps those who help themselves.  
强调主语:  
`He himself` went to visit the old lady. (他亲自去看望那个老太太的)  
不产生歧义下可置后:  
> He went to visti the old layd himself.  
He spoke to the boss himself.(有歧义)  

强调宾语:  反身代词在宾语后   
> He saw Tom himself. (他看到 Tom 本人)  
I will send this gift to John himself. (给 John 本人, 不是通过转交)  

介词 + 反身代词   
by oneself: 独自一人地   
> I went there by myself. (我自己一个人去了那里)   
I went there myself. (我亲自去了那里)

of oneself: 自动地  
> The door open `of` itself. (门自动地开了)


## 介词
特点: 不能单独使用, 后面需带宾语(名词, 代词, 数词, 动名词, 动名词短语, 名词从句)  
搭配: 在介词前的词: 动词(depend on) 名称(pay attention to) 形容词(be kind to)
