## 语法

句子是人类语言的核心构造, 动词是句子的核心. 所以学习英语语法需从句子开始.   
学习语法 --> 分析句子   
分析句子 --> 理清句子成分   
分析句子 --> 理清句子关系   

## 1.句子成分
* 主语: 句子所陈述的对象.
* 谓语: 主语发出的动作. 一般是有动作意义的动词.
* 宾语: 分为动词宾语和介词宾语, 属于动作的承受者.
* 系动词: 表示状态或状态变化的动词, 没有实际的动作意义.  如:  
    > be 动词 (`am`, `is` , `are`);    
      感官系动词 (`look`, `sound`, `smell`, `taste`, `feel`);    
      保持类系动词 (`keep`, `stay`, `remain`);    
      状态变化类系动词 (`become`, `get`, `turn`, `go`)    
   等.  
* 表语: 紧跟系动词后的成份.
* 定语: 修饰名词或代词的成份.
* 状语: 修饰形容词 / 副词 / 动词 或句子的成分.
* 补语: 分为宾语补足语和主语补足语. 是对宾语和主语的补充说明, 与其有主动或被动的逻辑关系.

## 2.句型
名子的基本结构: 主语 + 谓语(名词 + 动词)
### 五种句型
模式|例句|分析
:--:|:--:|:--:
主系表|I am a student|I 主语, am 系动词, a student 表语
主谓|I am studying|I 主语, am studying 谓语
主谓宾|I study English|I 主语, study 谓语, English 宾语
主谓间宾直宾|Our teacher taught us English|Our teacher 主语, taught 谓语, us 间宾, English 直宾
主谓宾宾补|I learn English well|I 主语, Learn 谓语, English 宾语, well 宾补

关键在于谓语动词, 它构成了一个句子的骨架   
 
#### 主语 + 系动词 + 主语补足语(表语)   
> 系动词(Linking Verg)   
作用: 无具体运作, 仅起连接作用   
后面所接成分: 说明主语特点性质特征    
种类: be 动词(`am`, `is`, `are`), `look`, `sound`, `smell`, `tast`, `feel`, `seem`, `appear`, `become`, `turn`. 
表语: 名词 or 形容词

#### 主语 + 谓语 (+ 状语)
> 不及物动词(Intransitive Verb) vi.   
> 特点: 主语自身可完成, 不需要作用对象   
> 习惯: 带状语(修饰动作的句子成分)

#### 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语
> 及对动词(Transitive Verb)vt.
> 作用: 说明主语动作的作用对象.
> 宾语: 主语动作承受对象

#### 主语 + 谓语 + 间宾 + 直宾
> 双宾动词(Dative Verb)
> 特点: 后面成分有人(间接宾语[接受者]), 又有物(直接宾语[承受者])

#### 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 + 宾语补足语
> 宾补动词(Factitive Verb)

### 区分双宾语和复合宾语
在间接宾语后加上 be 动词, 若能成句, 则是补足语

动词种类|句型
:--:|:--:
Linking verb(连系动词)|主 + 系 + 表
Intransitive Verb(不及物动词)|主 + 谓
Transitive Verb(及物动词)|主 + 谓 + 宾
Transitive Verb with direct object and indirect object|主 + 谓 +间宾 +直宾
Transitive Verb with direct object and object complement|主 + 谓 + 宾 +宾补

## 3.动词的分类

### 实义动词_Notional_Verb
> 词义: 完整    
> 作用: 能独立充当谓语    
> 分类: 助动词和情态动词以外的动词

### 助动词_Auxiliary_Verb
> 词义: 不完整    
> 作用: 无法独立充当谓语    
>      必须与实义动词连用, 构成各种时态, 语态, 语气, 否定, 疑问   
> 分类:    
     * Be: `am`, `is`, `are`, `was`, `were`, `been`, `being`    
     * Do: `does`, `did`   
     * Have: `has`, `had`, `having`

#### Be 类
> 变化形式: `am`, `is`, `are`, `was`, `were`, `been`, `being`    
> 功能:    
> 1. 帮助构成进行时态   
> I am studying grammar.   
> He is playing football.
> 2. 帮助构成被动语态   
> I was cheated.

#### Do 类
> 变化形式: `does`, `did`    
> 功能: 
> 1. 帮助实义动词构成否定    
> I do not like English.
> 2. 帮助实义动词构成疑问   
>  Do you like English.

#### Have 类
> 变化形式: `has`, `had`, `having`   
> 功能: 帮助构成完成时态    
> I have studied English for 3 years.

be, do, have 可作实义动词又可作助动词
分类|例句|词义|词性及作用
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
be|I am a student|"是"|系动词, 作谓语
-|I am studying grammar|无词义|助动词, 构成进行时
have|I have two brothers|"有"|实义动词, 作谓语
-|I have studied English for 3 years|无词义|助动词帮助构成完成时
do| I often do my homework at home|"做"|实义动词, 作谓语
-|I do not link English|无词义|助动词, 构成否定

### 情态动词_Modal_Verb
> 词义: 有词义, 表示说话者对某种行为或状态的看法或态度  
> 无法独立充当谓语, 必须和实义动词一起构成复合谓语  
> 常见: `can`, `could`, `may`, `might`, `must`, `shall`, `should`, `will`, `would`, `have to`, `ought to`, `used to`, `need`, `dare`  

## 4.句子的变化
### 陈述句否定

> 变形: 助动词或情态动词后 + not   
> 例:   
> He is a teacher. -> He is not a teacher.  
> I can swim. -> I cannot swim.
> He will come to the party. -> He will not come to the party.
#### 谓语动词是实义动词
> 变形: 借助助动词的 do not 来构成, 第三人称用 does + not + 动词原型, 过去式 did + not  
> 例:  
> I like English. -> I do not like English.  
> He like English. -> He does not like English.  
> There are some dogs. -> There aren't any dogs.

主格和宾格人称代码可做同位语  
> `We teachers` should be patient with students.  
Our teachers are all nice to `us students`.  

做宾语时的位置  
直接宾语前: He bought me a pen as birthday gift.   
直接宾语后: He boutht a pen for me as a birthday gift; I've lent much money to him.  

若直接宾语是人称代词, 只能置后, 但是不适用于不定代词:  
> I will give it to you.  
I'll show you something; I didn't give Rex any.  

在短语动词中间: hand them in; throw it away; pick it up.  
若是名词, 则中间和后边都可以: hand your papers in = hand in your papers.

### 物主代词(名词性&形容词性)

表强调时 + own: I wish I had my own house.

> 单独使用; 避免重复: This is not my book, Mine(= my book) is in my bag.   
of + 名词性物主代词: a friend fo mine; a teacher of hers = a teacher of her own.
